### GitHub
dingoPDM is split between 3 GitHub repos.

The latest releases can be found on the Releases page for each repo:

- Hardware: [dingoPDM](https://github.com/corygrant/dingoPDM/releases)
- Firmware: [dingoPDM_FW](https://github.com/corygrant/DingoPDM_FW/releases)
- Software: [DingoConfigurator](https://github.com/corygrant/DingoConfigurator/releases)

dingoPDM-Max is split between 2 GitHub repos. 

The latest releases can be found on the Releases page for each repo:

- Hardware: [dingoPDM-Max](https://github.com/corygrant/dingoPDM-Max)
- Firmware: [dingoPDM-Max_FW](https://github.com/corygrant/dingoPDM-Max_FW)

!!! Note
    dingoPDM will ship with the latest firmware release installed at the time of shipping, but new firmware is released frequently. 

    Check the Releases page for a new release when receiving the dingoPDM and follow the [Firwmare Updating](https://corygrant.github.io/dingoPDM/firmware/updating/) instructions.

## Test Config File

When first powering on dingoPDM, whether one received from the store or built yourself, the included test file can be used to verify functionality. 

The test file includes a very basic setup:

- All outputs:
    - Enabled
    - Set to turn on with input 1
    - Set to their max current limit with endless reset
- Input 1 set to: 
    - Pullup
    - Invert
    - Momentary
    
Connect input 1 to ground to turn all outputs on. 

## Changing CAN ID

The CAN Base ID default value is 2000. 

To change this, modify the value in the [DeviceTree](../software/devicetree.md) and press `Update` and then `Burn` to save the setting. 

On the next power up, the CAN Base ID will be updated. 


## Goals

- [X] Learn more about PDMs and high DC current devices
- [X] Learn about developing firmware for a more complex STM32 based project
- [X] Create a low cost device that my friends and I can use in our project cars
- [X] Layout the board to fit simple case designs
    * [X] 3D printed top shell and flat aluminum heatsinks (no machining)
- [X] Use low cost 1oz/0.5oz 4 layer PCBs (low cost 2oz/1oz now available from JLCPCB)
- [X] Share my work with others for reference, inspiration or collaboration. 
- [X] Document the project in a professional way to make it easy to use and access
- [X] Develop an easy to use configuration PC software
- [X] Offer fully built devices for sale
