| 1| Measure resistance between: TODO: verify measurement points                                        |                                                                               |
| 2| Connect USB and verify: 3v3, Power LED                                                             |                                                                               |
| 3| Connect +12v and verify 5v                                                                         |                                                                               |
| 4| Write FW to processor                                                                              | [FW Releases](https://github.com/corygrant/DingoPDM_FW/releases)              |
| 5| Verify that the `Status` LED goes green after one power cycle of red LED (writed default config)   |                                                                               |
| 6| Enable each output in the Configurator. Verify that the output A values are 0.                     |                                                                               |
| 7| Measure +12V at each output pad                                                                    |                                                                               |
