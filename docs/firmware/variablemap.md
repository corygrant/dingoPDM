To enable software configuration a Variable Map is maintained on the device. 

Each variable of the variable map corresponds to the result of another item. 

These are used to:

- Control the output on/off
- Create logic with the Virtual Inputs
- Control wipers
- Turn flashers on/off
- Engage the starter disable

!!! Warning
    The Variable Map is subject to change as new functions/features are added. 

    New values will always be added to the end of the map.
